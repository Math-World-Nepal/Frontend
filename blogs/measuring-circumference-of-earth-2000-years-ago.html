            Eratosthenes compared the position of the sun's rays in two places
            in order to calculate the spherical size of the earth with
            reasonable accuracy.
          </p>
          <img src="/images/blog/Image 1 (1).png" alt="old map" />
          <p>
            Eratosthenes learned about a famous fountain in the Egyptian city of
            Swenet (Greek Syene, today Aswan) on the Nile. One noon of the year,
            the summer solstice (between June 20 and 22), the sun's rays shone
            directly into the deep well and only illuminated the water at the
            bottom, not the sides of the well as on other days, which showed
            that the Sun was directly above it (Syene was very close to what we
            call the Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees). North, the northernmost
            degree of latitude where the sun is always directly overhead at
            noon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eratosthenes erected a mast in Alexandria, and at the summer
            solstice he observed that he was casting a shadow that shows that
            the sun was not directly over his head, but The knowledge of the
            curvature of the earth and the knowledge of the distance between the
            two cities enabled Eratosthenes to calculate the circumference of
            the planet. Eratosthenes was able to measure the angle of the sun's
            rays with respect to the vertical that divides the length of the
            opposite limb to the south. Angle (the length of the shadow) through
            the leg next to the angle (the height of the post). This gave it an
            angle of 7.12 degrees.He knew that the circumference of the earth
            was a 360-degree circle, so 7.12 (or 7.2 to divide 360 ​​evenly by
            50) degrees was about one-fiftieth of the circumference. He also
            knew the approximate distance between Alexandria and Siena so he
            could work out this equation:
            <br />
            `"Angle Difference" / 360 = "Distance between cities" / "Distance
            around the Earth"`
          </p>
          <p>
            Eratosthenes estimated the distance from Alexandria to Syene to be
            5,000 stadia or about 800 kilometers. He made this estimate from the
            time it took hikers, trained to measure distances at regular paces,
            between cities. In solving the equation, he calculated a
            circumference of 250,000 stadiums, or 25,000 miles (40,000
            kilometers).
          </p>
          <img
            src="/images/blog/circumference-calculations.png"
            alt="Diagram showing the calculations"
          />

          <p>
            Eratosthenes’ calculations and our explanations revealed various
            sources of errors. As a unit of measurement, he uses the Greek unit
            "stadium" or the length of the stadium on the one hand. But not all
            stadiums are the same length. In Greece, the size of the stadium is
            about 185 meters (607 feet), while in Egypt, the size of the stadium
            is about 157.5 meters (517 feet). We don't know which unit
            Eratostheni uses. If you use the Greek dimension, your calculation
            will look like the following. If you use the Egyptian survey, your
            error is less than 2% of the earth’s true circumference of 40,008
            kilometers.
          </p>

          <p>
            A century later in Eratosthenes, the astronomer Posidonius (c.
            135-51 BC) of Rhodes in Greece calculated the circumference of the
            earth. Posidonius uses the Canopus star as a reference system: if a
            star can be seen on the horizon of Rhode Island, then in Alexandria,
            it is 7.5 degrees above the horizon. His first calculation was
            almost accurate, but he modified the distance between Rhode Island
            and Alexandria, and the result was about 29,000 kilometers, which is
            28% less than the actual range. Ptolemy reported Posidonius’
            calculations, not Eratosthenes, and Ptolemy’s work passed to
            Christopher Columbus. If Ptolemy used the largest and most accurate
            Eratosthenes to calculate the circumference of the earth, Columbus
            might never sail west.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eratosthenes lived to be approximately eighty-two years old, whilst
            he starved himself to death due to the fact he feared the onset of
            blindness.
