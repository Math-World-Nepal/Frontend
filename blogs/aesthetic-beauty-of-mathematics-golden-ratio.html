            Mathematics is beautiful because it’s able to interpret everything
            that the universe holds. And the golden ratio has added finesse to
            the world of mathematics. Hang on, before we start let’s know what
            golden ratio is. Golden ratio (&phi;) is `(1 + sqrt(5))/2`
            (1.61803398875...) which is obtained by dividing two successive
            Fibonacci numbers. The series of numbers formed by adding two
            numbers before them starting with 0 and 1 is called a Fibonacci
            sequence. And when you draw a square with these Fibonacci numbers
            you get a spiral called logarithmic spiral.
          </p>

          <p>
            But what’s the deal with this spiral? Think for a minute, you will
            feel quite familiar with this spiral shape. Well that is because it
            looks like a shell of a nautilus. What’s more, the petals of flowers
            follow a Fibonacci sequence. Not just petals but natural phenomena
            such as hurricanes also form similar logarithmic spirals. You will
            be shocked to know that even our own bodies exhibit the golden ratio
            properties. For example, the measurement from the navel to the floor
            and the top of the head to the navel is the golden ratio. Animal
            bodies also exhibit similar tendencies just like us!
          </p>

            Going back to the time in 1202, Fibonacci also known as Leonardo of
            Pisa conducted a rabbit experiment where he counted the population
            of rabbits in one year. He supposed a newly-born pair of rabbits,
            one male, one female, were put in a field. Rabbits are able to mate
            in one month so that at the end of its second month a female can
            produce another pair of rabbits. Suppose that our rabbits never die
            and that the female always produces one new pair (one male, one
            female) every month from the second month on. The puzzle that
            Fibonacci posed was. How many pairs will there be in one year? And
            the answer of course is a Fibonacci number located at the 12th
            position. You know what, your family tree might also work the same
            way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Speaking of the ancient period, the famous ancient buildings such as
            the great pyramid of Giza, the Parthenon, Eiffel tower, Taj Mahal,
            Notre Dame in Paris are all claimed to be built with the golden
            ratio dimensions. That’s why they are so golden! You might possibly
            argue with this claim. But the architects have taken the dimensions
            of these buildings and found out to be in the golden ratio. Even
            today’s buildings such as the UN Secretariat building and Toronto’s
            CN tower are in golden ratio.
          </p>

          <p>
            The galaxies are also quite similar to the logarithmic spirals
            tracing the golden ratio dimensions. The DNA in our human body is
            also in golden ratio meaning that the DNA molecules are 34 Angstroms
            long and 21 Angstroms wide for each full cycle of double helix
            spiral. DNA in the cell appears as a double-stranded helix referred
            to as B-DNA. This form of DNA has a two groove in its spirals, with
            a ratio of phi in the proportion of the major groove to the minor
            groove, or roughly 21 angstroms to 13 angstroms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, the golden ratio really is golden and prevalent
            everywhere, be it in nature, the universe, human body, animals,
            plants or elsewhere. All thanks to Italian Mathematician Fibonacci
            who provided us the golden ratio, perfectly irrational but quite
            astounding. The takeaway of the golden ratio is that wherever you
            use it, it will foster organic and natural-looking compositions that
            are aesthetically pleasing to the eyes.
