          <p>
            How could we cope with shorter days and less sleep? How would it
            affect our climate and geography? Can We Survive Faster? We don't
            feel the earth spinning because, along with everything else on this
            planet, we're spinning with it. The world spins at about 1,600 km /
            h (1,000 mph) at the equator and completes a full revolution in 24
            hours. But the further you go from the equator, the slower you turn,
            because the earth becomes narrower the further you move north or
            south.
          </p>
          <p>
            So if you were at the equator, you would cover 25,000 miles (40,234
            km) in one day. But if it were about 3 meters from the North Pole,
            it would only rotate about 20 meters in 24 hours. If you have timing
            issues, record both the original and the alternative: if you spin
            twice as fast, you'll be back in half the time. That is if there is
            still ground to stand ... if you spin twice as fast, you lose half
            the day. Time flies by, but you'll start with the good news: weight
            loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right, if the world spun twice as fast you would weigh a lot less.
            All-day, every day, the centrifugal force of the earth's rotation
            threatens to shake the planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, gravity is stronger and keeps you on the ground.
            However, at the equator, you weigh about 0.5 kg less because where
            the earth rotates faster, more centrifugal force is generated, which
            reduces the force of gravity a little. Twice as fast as the rotation
            of the earth, and we are all the biggest losers! That's ... because
            things are getting a lot worse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of all of your favorite television shows and try to accept the
            fact that most of the satellites used for communications, military
            intelligence, and television broadcasting are in sync with the
            Earth's rotation. Even the slightest increase in speed would knock
            them out of orbit. But who has time? For television these days? When
            the days are only half as long? Do you think you could work with 4
            hours of sleep instead of 8? How about one or two meals a day
            instead of three?
          </p>
          <p>
            People would have to design new schedules and new calendars. Because
            instead of 365 days a year, it would now be 730. Hopefully, there
            would also be twice as many holidays ... Switching to a new body
            clock would be difficult, and not everyone would be successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            The weather could no longer be saved. For starters, extreme weather
            would be a lot more, well, extreme due to the curvature of the
            earth, the wind, and the curvature of the water, as well as their
            spread across the surface of the earth. This is the Coriolis Effect,
            and it is this phenomenon that gives hurricanes their rotation. The
            faster the earth rotates, the more the winds bend, the more eddies
            rotate, and the more energy they carry with them. Conclusion:
            deadliest disasters.
          </p>
          <p>
            So next time you have a long day, be glad it wasn't any shorter. Our
            way of life depends on it. Live at the moment, 24 hours a day, 365
            days a year.
